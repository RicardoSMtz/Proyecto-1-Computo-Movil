# Proyecto-1-Computo-Movil
# Android Formula Calculator App

This is a mobile application developed using the official IDE **Android Studio** for an academic project in the Mobile Computing course.

## üì± What Is It?

This app is a formula calculator that allows users to select one of four predefined formulas from a **drop-down menu** and calculate results based on user input. Each formula requires at least two input values. The app dynamically updates its interface depending on the selected formula and displays an illustrative image of the formula in use.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Drop-down menu** with four fixed formulas to choose from
- **Dynamic interface** that adapts based on the selected formula
- **Input validation** to prevent incorrect calculations
- **User-friendly UI** with visual representations of formulas
- **Calculation results** shown after data is entered and validated
- **Multilingual support**: English and Spanish
- **Custom app icon**
- **Minimum API level**: 26

## üìã Example Formulas (User-Defined)

- Quadratic formula (second-degree equation)
- Triangle area
- Speed calculation
- Rectangle perimeter

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Validations

The app includes input checks and shows error messages if:
- Any required input is missing
- The input leads to invalid operations (e.g., a negative discriminant in the quadratic formula)

## üåç Language Support

This application supports:
- **English**
- **Spanish**

All textual content is loaded from resource files; **no hardcoded strings** are used.

## üéØ Purpose

The main objective of this project is to apply core Android development concepts, including UI design, user interaction handling, localization, and validation logic.
